# Pokemon Rose Red and Iris Blue

A few years ago, there was a Gen 1 Pet Mod called Rose Red/Iris Blue. The goal of the Pet Mod was to make every fully Pokemon both usuable and at least somewhat viable in OU. Unfortunately, it's no longer playable due to the shutdown of RBY2k20. So I decided to turn it into a rom hack!

## Features

- Most Pokemon have recived buffs ranging from simple stat ups to entire type changes and new moves
- Several Moves have recived changes to make them much better
- To balance them, Mew and Mewtwo have recived several significant nerfs. They've also been moved elsewhere (Hint: Go back to where it all began.)
	- In Mewtwo's place, someone special is waiting for you.

(For a list of changes to most of the above, see [**here**](http://thedominiky.com/rby2k20/pokedex.php?meta=rrib)).

**There's also a few mechanic changes:**

Freeze now functions like it's modern gen counter part (30% to thaw each turn)
Sleep only last for 5 turns max.
255/511 recovery bug and 1/256 glitch have been patched
Trapping Moves only trap for 2-3 turns

**In addition, the hack has several QOL features:**

- Move Reminder in PC
- Portable PC
- Running Shoes
- BW2 Repels
- HM Moves now function like TMs do (Tossable in bag, and deletable. They can be purchased at various marts around the region.)
- Reusable TMs
- HM Items
